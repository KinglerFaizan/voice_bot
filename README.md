⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

"System not speaking?"

Modern browsers block auto-playing audio. You MUST click the "BOOT SYSTEM" button at the start to grant audio permissions.

Check if your browser tab is muted.

"Microphone not working?"

Ensure your browser has permission to access the microphone (Check the lock icon 🔒 in the URL bar).

This application works best on Chrome and Edge.
